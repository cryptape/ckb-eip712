    This tool produces hashes based on the metamask v4 rules. This is different
   from the EIP-712 spec in how arrays of structs are hashed but is compatable
   with metamask. See https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-sig-util/pull/107

    eip712 data rules:
    Parser wants to see C strings, not javascript strings:
        requires all complete json message strings to be enclosed by braces,
   i.e., { ... } Cannot have entire json string quoted, i.e., "{ ... }" will not
   work. Remove all quote escape chars, e.g., {"types":  not  {\"types\": int
   values must be hex. Negative sign indicates negative value, e.g., -5, -8a67
        Note: Do not prefix ints or uints with 0x
    All hex and byte strings must be big-endian
    Byte strings and address should be prefixed by 0x
